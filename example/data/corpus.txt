aeroallergens
practice essentials  both outdoor and indoor aeroallergens sensitize and exacerbate allergic asthma, and more than 90% of the average person's time in developed countries is spent indoors
major indoor aeroallergens are derived from dust mites (see the image below), cockroaches, cat, dog, and other furry-animal debris, and fungi

see all about allergies: be ready for spring, a critical images slideshow, to help identify a variety of allergens and symptoms
avoidance measures and interventions  the physician has the following 3 treatment options for individuals with allergic diseases, including allergic asthma:  aeroallergen avoidance medications allergen immunotherapy avoidance of the offending agent is the first line of treatment for allergic disorders and asthma
it is the most cost-effective treatment modality, and it sometimes results in complete resolution of an allergic problem
modification of the home environment is the primary measure to reduce allergen exposure
a comprehensive strategy should include determining the allergens to which the individual is sensitive and implementing specific avoidance measures to reduce exposure to the offending allergens
dust mites  dust mite bodies and fecal pellets are the major source of allergens in house dust
more than 80% of homes in the united states and 85% of day care facilities have detectable levels of dust mite allergens; half of us homes have levels higher than the proposed threshold levels for sensitization, and about 25% have levels at or higher than those required to induce asthma
avoidance strategies for dust mite allergens are as follows:  use impermeable (woven) covers (on the pillows, box spring, and mattress) eliminate dust reservoirs when possible (carpeting, upholstered furniture, stuffed animals, and drapery) vacuum weekly wear a pollen mask when cleaning wash bedding weekly reduce indoor humidity  furry animals  furry pets include, for example, cats, dogs, ferrets, and rabbits
avoidance strategies for furry animal allergens are as follows:  remove the pet from the home or other dwelling restrict the pet's access (eg, keep the pet out of the bedroom) bathe the pet use impermeable covers use high-efficiency particulate air (hepa) central air conditioning filters  rodents  avoidance strategies for rodent allergens are as follows:   restrict access to the home, building, or other dwelling  eliminate food and water supply  use rodent predators  use rodent traps  cockroaches  avoidance strategies for cockroach allergens are as follows:  clean thoroughly use pesticides – preferably gel or baits, selectively placed in the kitchen after thorough cleaning eliminate food and water supply  fungi  most of the fungi recovered from an indoor environment emanate from outside
however, certain species, such as penicillium and aspergillus, can be found in greater quantities indoors
avoidance strategies for fungal allergens are as follows:  reduce spore infiltration – keep windows and doors closed as much as possible control moisture – decrease the indoor humidity level to less than 50%, if possible cleaning – a detergent solution with 5% bleach is useful for washable wallpaper and paneling use central air conditiong hepa filters wear masks when cleaning  overview  in 1921, r
a
kern noted that a patient with asthma had a positive prick-puncture skin test to extracts obtained from her mattress
the patient's asthma improved after she enclosed the mattress in heavy packing paper and thoroughly cleaned the room
in 1925, storm van leeuwen successfully treated individuals with asthma by moving them to high altitudes or enclosing them in an allergen-proof chamber
despite the early recognition that environmental exposure to allergens causes allergic diseases, indoor allergen avoidance is still an underused treatment
even when properly prescribed by physicians, the benefits of indoor allergen avoidance are often decreased by inadequate patient adherence
atopic diseases, which affect up to 30% of the population in some countries, are an increasing problem, particularly in developed countries
allergic diseases and asthma also cause substantial morbidity and mortality
asthma affects almost 300 million people worldwide and accounts for 1 in 250 deaths
in the united states, approximately 3 million people are hospitalized for acute asthma each year
half of all adults and 80% of children with asthma have an allergic component to their disease, and high levels of allergen exposure are linked to increased asthma symptoms in these individuals
both outdoor and indoor aeroallergens sensitize and exacerbate allergic asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis
major outdoor allergens include those derived from the pollens of trees, grasses, and weeds
major indoor allergens are derived from dust mites, cockroaches, cat, dog, and other furry-animal debris, and fungi (see table 1, below)
allergens are located both in homes and in other indoor environments
for example, several studies show that most day care facilities sampled have detectable levels of major indoor allergens; many contain levels sufficient to cause sensitization and exacerbation of allergic diseases
table 1
major indoor aeroallergens (open table in a new window) the physician has the following 3 treatment options for individuals with allergic diseases, including allergic asthma:  aeroallergen avoidance medications allergen immunotherapy more than 90% of the average person's time in developed countries is spent indoors
this statistic underscores the importance of avoidance measures, especially in those who are allergic to indoor allergens
modern medicine has vastly increased the effective treatment of allergic disorders and asthma
however, the first line of treatment for these diseases is to avoid the offending agent
therefore, the clinician should instruct those with allergies to indoor aeroallergens about practical matters to decrease exposure to these allergens
this is the most cost-effective treatment modality, and it sometimes results in complete resolution of the allergic problem
avoidance measures and interventions  indoor allergens can be avoided using two primary techniques
first, the sensitized individual can be moved away from the allergen; second, the home environment can be modified to reduce allergen exposure
the latter strategy is usually more practical in clinical practice (see table 2, below)
controversy exists over the effectiveness of individual environmental control strategies, but a comprehensive approach to allergen avoidance is superior to a single intervention
conflicting results among studies that address primary prevention of atopic disorders have failed to lead to a consensus for recommendations for allergic subjects or parents who wish to decrease the risk of atopy in their children
the recommendations for allergen avoidance cannot be uniform for everyone
a comprehensive strategy should include determining the allergens to which the individual is sensitive and implementing specific avoidance measures to reduce exposure to the offending allergens
furthermore, no avoidance strategy is complete without a thorough discussion with the patient or the patient's family regarding the role of allergens in the disease
the success of such a strategy depends on correct identification of relevant allergens, the physician's attitude regarding the effectiveness of avoidance measures, and patient motivation and means to apply this strategy
table 2
general recommendations for aeroallergen avoidance (open table in a new window)    dust mites  dust mite debris is the major source of allergens in house dust
this microscopic arthropod primarily feeds on organic materials, including skin scales, fungi, and bacteria
dust mites lack an organized respiratory system and their water supply is derived from the ambient air
seasonal changes in relative humidity can affect the concentrations of dust mite allergen, and these fluctuations can contribute to allergic symptoms in the sensitized individual
in the home, mites typically infest objects that contain fabrics; for example, higher concentrations of mites are found in pillows, box springs, mattresses, bedding, carpets, throw rugs, drapery, stuffed animals, and upholstered furniture
higher concentrations are usually found in older homes, in regions of high humidity, and in homes with heating units other than forced air
cold, dry air at high altitudes is not conducive to dust mite growth
both the mite bodies and fecal pellets are major sources of mite allergens, which become airborne when disturbed
dust mite allergens are predominately contained on aerodynamic particles 10 µm or larger in diameter and remain in the air for 30 minutes or less
in contrast, cat allergens are predominately carried on smaller particles, with an average size of 5 µm, and can remain in undisturbed air for days
allergens are named according to the first 3 letters of the genus and the first letter of the species (eg, the allergen for dermatophagoides pteronyssinus is classified as der p and dermatophagoides farinae [see the image below] is classified as der f)
allergens are grouped according to biologic function and homology
the major sources of dust mite allergens are the group 1 allergens der p 1 and der f 1
electron photomicrograph of dermatophagoides farinae
the concentration of dust mite allergens (an indirect assessment of exposure) is measured in micrograms per gram (μg/g) of settled dust from samples obtained by vacuuming a defined area of a carpet or mattress
the proposed threshold concentration of allergen exposure required to sensitize to dust mites is 2 μg of group 1 allergen (der p 1 and der f 1) per gram of dust
levels of 10 μg/g of dust induce allergic symptoms or asthma in sensitized persons, but lower levels may also cause symptoms
evidence that sensitization may occur at even lower levels also exists; hence, an individual genetically predisposed to develop allergic diseases may not have a safe level of exposure
more than 80% of homes in the united states and 85% of daycare facilities have detectable levels of dust mite allergens
furthermore, half of us homes have levels higher than the proposed threshold levels for sensitization; about 25% have levels at or higher than those required to induce asthma
avoidance measures  impermeable covers several studies show that using impermeable mattress covers is not an effective strategy by itself to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis or asthma in dust mite-sensitized subjects
however, a study by morgan et al demonstrates significant benefit of impermeable covers when used as part of a comprehensive and individualized allergen avoidance program
impermeable covers are composed of either vinyl or tightly woven fabrics and serve as effective dust mite barriers
because vinyl is impermeable to air, it tends to be hotter and less comfortable than a woven cover, which is more comfortable but, usually, more expensive
in addition, nonwoven mattress encasements accumulate mite allergen, in contrast to woven encasements
in either case, the covers used should encase the pillows, box spring, and mattress
these coverings may be purchased from retail stores, web sites (eg, www
natlallergy
com), mail-order catalogs, and allergy specialty stores
elimination of dust reservoirs the removal of dust reservoirs remains an important part of the avoidance program, although it can be difficult and expensive
removal of carpets, draperies, and upholstered furniture decreases mite exposure
removal of stuffed toys, books, or other items that collect dust, particularly in the bedroom can be helpful
vacuuming weekly vacuuming is recommended, and vacuum bags should have 2 layers or a hepa filter to decrease aerosolized allergen exposure because of the air disturbance
individuals allergic to dust mites should try to avoid vacuuming or being present when the bag is changed
the use of a pollen mask (eg, nexcare all-purpose mask [3m, st paul, minn]) can also be helpful for sensitized individuals who are unable to avoid vacuuming
dehumidifiers because dust mites depend on a humid environment to live, reducing the relative humidity level to less than 50% can be helpful
however, a level of relative humidity low enough to effectively restrict mite population growth is difficult to maintain in most locales
central dehumidifiers are expensive and are not very effective, particularly in areas that have a high humidity all year
bedroom dehumidifiers are not effective and are not recommended for routine use
washing dust mites have 90% to 98% mortality in cold water washing, indicating that most mites die by drowning
residential hot water should be set below 49º c (120º f) given the effectiveness of kiling dust mites at lower temperatures to prevent scalding of occupants
drying all dust mites were killed when a blanket was dried for 10 minutes, and 99% of dust mites were killed when a duvet (comforter) was dried for 1 hour in a clothes dryer
air purifiers air purifiers alone are not useful for dust mite allergen control because dust mites do not remain airborne for long periods
thus, the routine use of air purifiers is not recommended because clinical benefits are not documented
freezing dust mites die when frozen; therefore, stuffed toys and other such items can be placed in a domestic freezer at -15º c (5º f) for at least 16 hours to decrease dust reservoirs
in climates where the outside temperature drops below freezing, rugs, blankets, mattresses, or other items can be placed outside for 2-3 days to kill dust mites
acaricides studies investigating the use of acaricides on carpeting to kill dust mites have yielded mixed results
benzyl benzoate kills 90% of mites in culture within 12 hours, however, these effects are short-lived and the acaricide on the carpet should be reapplied every 2-3 months
furthermore, a decrease in dust mite allergens in carpeting may not be clinically beneficial
duct cleaning because dust mites do not typically reside in air ducts, cleaning air ducts does not decrease exposure
relocation although not very practical, moving to locations that are less favorable for dust mite growth can be beneficial
for example, high altitudes or arid locales are associated with less mite growth
house dust mite sl immunotherapy  a sublingual (sl) house dust mite immunotherapy (odactra) was approved by the fda in 2017
it is a standardized allergen extract indicated as daily sl immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis, with or without conjunctivitis, confirmed by in vitro testing for ige antibodies to dermatophagoides farinae or dermatophagoides pteronyssinus house dust mites, or skin testing to licensed house dust mite allergen extracts
the first dose must be given in a healthcare setting under the supervision of a physician with experience in diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases
patient monitoring for signs or symptoms of a severe systemic or local allergic reaction is required following administration
life-threatening allergic reactions is described in a boxed warning within the prescribing information
the boxed warning also includes the need to prescribe autoinjectable epinephrine for the patient to have while using hdm immunotherapy
approval was based on a double-blind, multicenter trial (n = 1482) in adolescents and adults with hdm allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis (ar/c)
over a 52-week period, hdm immunotherapy improved rhinoconjunctivitis score and visual analog scale-assessed ar/c symptoms (p <0
001)
furry pets  furry pets include, for example, cats does, rodents, ferrets and rabbits
in the united states, 62% of households have one or more domestic pet
the two most common animals are cat and dog; thus, these animals are major contributors to indoor allergen exposure
cases of sensitization and allergy to rabbit, gerbil, hamster, ferret and other animals are also described in the literature
for this reason, it is imporant to elicit an adequate pet history
of the households with a cat, 17% of the individuals who live with them are sensitized based on a positive skin prick test to cat extract
however, only 5% of dog owners have a positive skin prick test to dog extract
in a study by arbes et al, all sampled homes in the united states, even those that have never had an animal in the house, contain dog allergen and most contain cat allergen
furthermore, most homes contain levels that excede the proposed levels for both sensitization and exacerbation of asthma symptoms
felis domesticus (fel d 1), the major cat allergen, is produced primarily in the sebaceous glands and is secreted onto the skin and fur
this allergen also is present in the salivary glands; thus, cats add additional allergen to their fur when they clean themselves
the allergen is carried on small particles and remains airborne for long periods
thus, decreased ventilation in the home leads to increased levels of cat allergen
unlike dust mite allergen, cat allergen can be found even at high levels on the walls and other surfaces within the home
the major dog allergens, canis familiaris 1 (can f 1) and canis familiaris 2 (can f 2), have physical properties similar to those of cat allergens
a truly hypoallergenic cat has not been produced, as published in the lay literature
an article by vredegoor et al demonstrates that can f 1 levels are significantly higher in hair and coat samples in dog breeds referred to as hypoallergenic; that is, they are no less allergenic than any other dogs
although some variations exist in other characteristics, such as whether a dog was bathed, no measured parameters significantly influenced the conclusions of the study
these data are confirmed by another study by nicholas ce et al, which indicates that there is no evidence for differential shedding of allergens by dogs grouped as hypoallergenic
the amount of exposure to an animal allergen necessary to cause sensitization is controversial
the proposed threshold level for sensitization to cat allergen is 1 µg of fel d 1 per gram of dust, and the level to cause symptoms in susceptible individuals with asthma is 8 µg of fel d 1 per gram of dust
for dog allergen, the proposed levels for sensitization and exacerbation are greater than 2 and 10 µg/g of can f 1 per gram, respectively
however, lower levels are reported to be associated with sensitization
observational studies suggest that high exposure to cat and dog allergen early in life is associated with a decreased risk of pet allergy
however, an earlier study suggests that the opposite is true
avoidance measures  removal of the pet one of the most important recommendations for the family—removal of the pet—may also be the most difficult to accept, since some pets are considered to be a part of the family
however, everyone must understand that continued exposure to a pet and its allergens occurs if the pet is kept in the home
those who are allergic to a pet need to implement effective lifestyle modifications to reduce their exposure to animal dander
once the pet is removed, the time required for allergen levels to decrease to levels at which allergic problems no longer occur can be as long as 6 months
restrict pet access if the family decides to keep the offending pet, the pet should be kept outdoors
a less desirable option is to keep the pet in one area of the home and out of the bedroom
bathing the pet the recommendation for a dog owner who is allergic to his or her pet is to bathe the pet at least weekly
however, the beneficial effects of reducing allergen levels by regular bathing are more likely to be successful for dogs because of the rapid buildup of the allergen burden in cats
can f 1 levels may be reduced below baseline values after bathing, superior to vacuuming the fur of a dog, which results in minimal allergen decline
studies evaluating pet bathings have yielded conflicting results; however, in all cases, the effects are transient
vacuuming a study of the effects of vacuuming the carpet on cat allergen levels in the home fail to show any beneficial effects even when modern hepa filters are used
in fact, the amount of cat allergen found increased, possibly because of the sweeping motion of the brushes on the carpeting and the air disturbance from the exhaust flow
{ref28] other measures impermeable coverings are recommended for the pillow, box spring, and mattress because animal allergens remain airborne much longer than dust mite allergens
air purifiers may be helpful; however, data to support their efficacy are lacking
elimination of the reservoirs for allergens is an important component of the avoidance strategy
chemical treatment with tannic acid or hypochlorite bleach (0
05% solution) modifies the allergens so that they are no longer allergenic
such treatment represents a temporary measure, at best, given that allergens reaccumulate
there is no evidence that tannic acid treatment improves respiratory health, while hypochlorite bleach can increase respiratory symptoms
cockroaches  of the 4500 known species of cockroaches in the world, four are pests, including the oriental cockroach (blatella orientalis), german cockroach (blatella germanica), american cockroach (periplaneta americana), and the brown-banded cockroach (supella loongipalpa)
the 2 most commonly encountered species are the german (blatella germanica) and the american (periplaneta americana) cockroaches (see the image below)
some species are capable of survival for long periods without food
cockroach allergens are derived from saliva, fecal material, secretions, and dead bodies
the airborne allergen particles from cockroaches are similar to dust mite aeroallergens in that they are relatively large (>10 µm in diameter)
as such, they tend to become airborne after disturbance and then quickly fall
the proposed threshold levels for sensitization and asthma symptoms are 0
04 and 0
08 µg of bla g 2 per gram of dust, respectively
comparison of common cockroaches
an association between cockroach sensitization and more frequent episodes of asthma in individuals in the emergency department is described
cockroach exposure in subjects with asthma who reside in inner-city areas could account for the disproportionately high morbidity in this population, and the association of low socioeconomic status and cockroach allergy appears to be independent of age, sex, and race
several studies demonstrate that cockroach allergy is found not only in the inner city but also in any substandard housing conditions or where apartments are infested with cockroaches
avoidance measures  pesticides an important aspect of cockroach eradication is the proper use of effective pesticides
because the kitchen is the main source of both food and water for these insects, this room contains the most roach allergen
pesticide spray is effective, but selective placement of gels or baits is preferred
potential targets should include any cracks or other points of entry throughout the house
cleaning before pesticide application, a thorough cleaning is recommended so that the cockroaches are more likely to feed on the gel or bait
all surfaces with potential contact with the insect should be cleaned to reduce allergen levels
particular attention should be paid to kitchen cabinets and the space around household appliances
the addition of liquid bleach facilitates removal of the allergens
daily vacuuming of carpets reduces cockroach allergen exposure
elimination of food and water supply access to food and water should be eliminated to effectively eliminate cockroaches from the home
food should be stored in sealed containers, and any sources of standing water should be removed
routine chores such as washing the dishes and removing the trash from the home should be done daily
food left out overnight promotes cockroach infestation
fungi  fungi are widely distributed throughout the world
they grow mycelium and reproduce asexually by budding and sexually through spores
these spores become airborne and have the potential to sensitize and cause symptoms in susceptible individuals
the optimal conditions for fungal growth vary greatly among different species, but all require oxygen, a carbohydrate source, and water
optimal temperatures vary but are usually between 18°c (64
4°f) and 32°c (89
6°f)
fungal growth may also be affected by climate change
higher outdoor levels of fungi are associated with concomitant high levels in the indoor environment
indeed, most of the fungi recovered from an indoor environment emanate from outside
however, certain species, such as penicillium and aspergillus, can be found in greater quantities inside buildings and homes
another source of indoor fungi are the transport of outdoor spores on clothing and animal fur into the indoor environment
in children with allergies, 63% of their homes have increased fungal levels
sixty-six percent of asthma sufferers have sensitization to one or more fungi on skin-prick testing or serum ige measurement
the threshold levels of allergens that are required to sensitize and exacerbate allergic symptoms have yet to be established
culture methods are usually used to determine exposure, using spore counts or quantitation of colony-forming units
an indoor source of fungal growth is suggested if the indoor concentration of individual types of fungi are greater indoors than outdoors
avoidance measures  reduce spore infiltration because most of the fungal spores detected in a home are derived from outdoors, windows and doors should be kept closed as much as possible
moisture control decrease the indoor humidity level to less than 50%, if possible
repair leaks, use air conditioning at times of high humidity, ventilate bathrooms and kitchens by using exhaust fans, and heat all rooms in the winter
cleaning a detergent solution with 6% bleach is useful for washable wallpaper and paneling
the disinfectant is prepared by adding 0
25-1
5 cups of bleach per gallon of water
removal of the contaminated source may be necessary to reduce allergen exposure
vacuuming frequently may also reduce fungal spore levels
air filters hepa filters are more effective than electrostatic air filters in removing fungal allergens from the air masks activities such as cleaning and vacuuming can expose the individual to various fungal allergens; therefore, a pollen mask is useful in such situations
rodents  rodents are the largest population of mammals in the world
the order rodentia includes rat, mouse, guinea pig, hamster and gerbil
rodents with less known clinical significance include beaver, muskrat, porcupine, woodchuck, chipmunk, squirrel, prairie dog, chinchilla, and others
eighty-two percent of homes had detectable mouse mus m1 allergen in a national us housing survey
levels of rodent allergen are higher in older, mobile, and low-income homes and in high-rise apartments
studies also show increased levels of rodent allergens in schools and daycare centers
exposure to the major mouse allergen, mus m 1, above 1
6 µg per gram of dust is associated with sensitization and may be a significant cause of asthma
laboratory animal facility workers typically develop sensitization within the first three years of employment
approximately 1/3 of these workers develop allergy to the animal and 1/3 of those who develop allergies will develop asthma
an atopic history and the intensity of exposure are risk factors for developing sensitization and symptoms
please refer to the “environmental assessment and exposure reduction of rodents: a practice parameter” for recommendations to reduce rodent exposure in the animal facility setting
avoidance measures  restricting access into building a rat may gain entry into the home through a hole as small as 3/4 and a mouse as small as 1/4 of an inch
all openings, including pipe entries should be sealed or covered with metal mesh to prevent entry and openings under doors minimized
debris and clutter located near the building should be removed to avoid masking evidence of rodent entry and as a potential rodent shelter
a non-vegetative border is recommended around the building perimeter to prevent the rodent from going undetected during movement from the outside to the inside of the building
elimination of food and water supply food sources, such as cereal, grain, and pet food should be stored in sealed containers
garbage should be removed from the building on a regular basis
use of rodent predators cats, owls, and snakes are rodent predators
a cat in the home may deter a mouse from entering the dwelling and reduce the mouse population
however, having a cat fails to completely eliminate a mouse population and is not a significant rat deterrent
one study indicates that 84% of subjects who were sensitized to mouse are also sensitized to cat so this intervention could cause more harm from the cat versus rodent sensitization
rodent traps three main types of rodent traps exist: snap traps, live traps, and glue boards
the rodent triggers the snap traps
a pea-size amount of bait is placed on the trap and the trap placed along the perimeter of the room
live traps use a baited cage with a one-way door to capture the rodent
glue boards can be used to capture rodents and also droppings and hair
allergic contact dermatitis
practice essentials  individuals with allergic contact dermatitis (see the image below) may have persistent or relapsing dermatitis, particularly if the material(s) to which they are allergic is not identified or if they practice inappropriate skin care
the longer an individual has severe dermatitis, the longer, it is believed, that the dermatitis will take to resolve once the cause is identified
chronic stasis dermatitis with allergic contact dermatitis to quaternium-15, a preservative in moisturizer
allergic contact dermatitis produces areas of erythema in areas of atrophie blanche and varicose veins
see 5 body modifications and piercing: dermatologic risks and adverse reactions, a critical images slideshow, to help recognize various body modifications and the related potential complications
signs and symptoms  acute allergic contact dermatitis is characterized by pruritic papules and vesicles on an erythematous base
lichenified pruritic plaques may indicate a chronic form of the condition
individuals with allergic contact dermatitis typically develop the condition within a few days of exposure, in areas that were exposed directly to the allergen
certain allergens (eg, neomycin), however, penetrate intact skin poorly; in such cases, the onset of dermatitis may be delayed for up to a week following exposure
individuals may develop widespread dermatitis from topical medications applied to leg ulcers or from cross-reacting systemic medications administered intravenously
intraoral metal contact allergy may result in mucositis that mimics lichen planus, which has an association with intraoral squamous cell carcinoma
see clinical presentation for more detail
diagnosis  diagnostic studies for allergic contact dermatitis include the following:  potassium hydroxide preparation and/or fungal culture: to exclude tinea; these tests are often indicated for dermatitis of the hands and feet patch testing: to identify external chemicals to which the person is allergic repeat open application test (roat): to determine whether a reaction is significant in individuals who develop weak or 1+ positive reactions to a chemical dimethylgloxime test: to determine whether a metallic object contains enough nickel to provoke allergic dermatitis skin biopsy: may help to exclude other disorders, particularly tinea, psoriasis, and cutaneous lymphoma see workup for more detail
management  the definitive treatment for allergic contact dermatitis is the identification and removal of any potential causal agents; otherwise, the patient is at increased risk for chronic or recurrent dermatitis
treatments also include the following:  corticosteroids: topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, although acute, severe allergic contact dermatitis, such as from poison ivy, often needs to be treated with a 2-week course of systemic corticosteroids topical immunomodulators (tims): approved for atopic dermatitis, but they are also prescribed for cases of allergic contact dermatitis when they offer safety advantages over topical corticosteroids phototherapy: administered to individuals with chronic allergic contact dermatitis that is not controlled well by topical corticosteroids; these patients may benefit from treatment with a combination of psoralen (a photosensitizer) and ultraviolet-a (puva) immunosuppressive agents: chronic immunosuppressive agents are, in rare instances, used to treat recalcitrant cases of severe, chronic, widespread allergic contact dermatitis or severe hand dermatitis that prevents a patient from working or performing daily activities disulfiram: occasionally, an individual who is highly allergic to nickel and has severe vesicular hand dermatitis will benefit from treatment with disulfiram (antabuse); the drug has a chelating effect see treatment and medication for more detail
background  allergic contact dermatitis (acd) is a delayed type of induced sensitivity (allergy) resulting from cutaneous contact with a specific allergen to which the patient has developed a specific sensitivity
this allergic reaction causes inflammation of the skin manifested by varying degrees of erythema, edema, and vesiculation
the term contact dermatitis sometimes is used incorrectly as a synonym for allergic contact dermatitis
contact dermatitis is inflammation of the skin induced by chemicals that directly damage the skin (see irritant contact dermatitis) and by specific sensitivity in the case of allergic contact dermatitis
jadassohn first described allergic contact dermatitis in 1895
he developed the patch test to identify the chemicals to which the patient was allergic
sulzberger popularized patch testing in the united states in the 1930s
the finn chamber method for patch testing was designed in the 1970s; these chambers consist of small metal cups, typically attached to strips of tape, filled with allergens dispersed in either petrolatum or water
the thin-layer rapid use epicutaneous (true) test for patch testing became available in the united states in the 1990s
the importance of specific substances as causes of allergic contact dermatitis varies with the prevalence of that substance in the environment
mercury compounds once were significant causes of allergic contact dermatitis but rarely are used as topical medications and, currently, are uncommon as a cause of allergic contact dermatitis
ethylenediamine, which was present in the original mycolog cream, declined as a primary cause of allergic contact dermatitis once mycolog cream was reformulated to no longer contain this allergen
a detailed history, both before and after patch testing, is crucial in evaluating individuals with allergic contact dermatitis
before patch testing, the history identifies potential causes of allergic contact dermatitis and the materials to which individuals are exposed that should be included in patch testing
after patch testing, the history determines the clinical significance of the findings
(see clinical
) topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, while a variety of symptomatic treatments can provide short-term relief of pruritus
however, the definitive treatment of allergic contact dermatitis is the identification and removal of any potential causal agents; otherwise, the patient is at increased risk for chronic or recurrent dermatitis
(see treatment
) go to irritant contact dermatitis, pediatric contact dermatitis, and protein contact dermatitis for complete information on these topics
pathophysiology  approximately 3000 chemicals are well documented as specific causes of allergic contact dermatitis
compounds must be less than 500 d for efficient penetration through the stratum corneum barrier, which is the water-impermeable outer layer of the skin
small organic molecules that are chemically reactive (chemical sensitizers) bind with self-proteins to generate immunogenic neoantigens through a process termed haptenization
although haptens can penetrate through intact skin, patients with certain disease states that impair barrier function (eg, leg ulcers, perianal dermatitis) have an increased risk of sensitization to topically applied medications and their vehicle components
many patients with atopic dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis to nickel harbor a defective form of the filaggrin gene
filaggrin helps aggregate cytoskeletal proteins that form the cornified cell envelope
in its absence, the barrier is defective
prehaptens are chemicals that are not activated by host proteins, but instead require chemical transformation by oxidative derivatization by ambient or air oxidation to form hydroperoxide
examples include certain fragrance materials and dyes used in hair coloring, such as para-phenylenediamine
haptens activate toll-like receptors (tlrs) and activate innate immunity
the importance of hapten-mediated activation of innate immunity is highlighted by the clinical observation that the irritancy of chemicals (ie, the ability of these chemicals to cause grossly visible skin inflammation upon primary exposure) correlates with their ability to act as contact sensitizers and to induce acute contact dermatitis
haptens or haptenated self-proteins are recognized by innate immune mechanisms in the skin, and this leads to the elaboration of a number of proinflammatory mediators, including interleukin (il)–1β
as a result, skin-resident dendritic cells (dcs) become activated
there are several populations of dcs
langerhans cells are the only dc subtype in the epidermis
like all skin-resident dcs, langerhans cells efficiently acquire antigen in the periphery and migrate to regional lymph nodes where they present antigen to naïve and memory t cells
these dcs, which may have been directly haptenated or could have acquired haptenated proteins from their surroundings, migrate to skin-draining lymph nodes where they present peptides from haptenated proteins to activate memory and naïve t cells
in the final step, hapten-induced inflammation recruits activated effector t cells back to the initial site of antigen encounter in the skin
the effector t cells release proinflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-γ, and promote the killing of haptenated cells, resulting in the development of the classic inflammatory rash seen in allergic contact dermatitis
keratinocytes are crucial for the development of allergic contact dermatitis
they constitute the vast majority of cells in the epidermis and form the anatomic barrier of the skin
keratinocytes express most tlrs, and this allows them to respond to tlr4-triggering haptens, such as nickel
keratinocytes are also a source of il-10, an immunosuppressive cytokine that limits the extent of contact hypersensitivity the initial sensitization typically takes 10-14 days from initial exposure to a strong contact allergen such as poison ivy
some individuals develop specific sensitivity to allergens following years of chronic low-grade exposure; for example, sensitivity to chromate in cement can eventually develop in individuals with chronic irritant contact dermatitis resulting from the alkaline nature of cement
once an individual is sensitized to a chemical, allergic contact dermatitis develops within hours to several days of exposure
cd4 ccr10 memory t cells persist in the dermis after clinical resolution of allergic contact dermatitis
etiology  approximately 25 chemicals appear to be responsible for as many as one half of all cases of allergic contact dermatitis
these include nickel, preservatives, dyes, and fragrances
poison ivy  poison ivy (toxicodendron radicans) is the classic example of acute allergic contact dermatitis in north america
allergic contact dermatitis from poison ivy is characterized by linear streaks of acute dermatitis that develop where plant parts have been in direct contact with the skin
nickel  nickel is the leading cause of allergic contact dermatitis in the world
the incidence of nickel allergic contact dermatitis in north america is increasing; in contrast, new regulations in europe have resulted in a decreasing prevalence of nickel allergy in young and middle-aged women
allergic contact dermatitis to nickel typically is manifested by dermatitis at the sites where earrings or necklaces (see the image below) containing nickel are worn or where metal objects (including the keypads of some cell phones) containing nickel are in contact with the skin
nickel may be considered a possible occupational allergen
workers in whom nickel may be an occupational allergen primarily include hairdressers, retail clerks, caterers, domestic cleaners, and metalworkers
individuals allergic to nickel occasionally may develop vesicles on the sides of the fingers (dyshidrotic hand eczema or pompholyx) from nickel in the diet
allergic contact dermatitis to nickel in a necklace
rubber gloves  allergy to 1 or more chemicals in rubber gloves is suggested in any individual with chronic hand dermatitis who wears them, unless patch testing demonstrates otherwise
allergic contact dermatitis to chemicals in rubber gloves typically occurs maximally on the dorsal aspects of the hand
usually, a cutoff of dermatitis occurs on the forearms where skin is no longer in contact with the gloves
individuals allergic to chemicals in rubber gloves may develop dermatitis from other exposures to the chemicals (eg, under elastic waistbands)
hair dye and temporary tattoos  p-phenylenediamine (ppd) is a frequent component of and sensitizer in permanent hair dye products and temporary henna tattoos; exposure in to it in hair dye products may cause acute dermatitis with severe facial edema
severe local reactions from ppd may occur in black henna tattoos in adults and children
epidemiologic data indicate that the median prevalence of positive patch test reactions to ppd among dermatitis patients is 4
3% (increasing) in asia, 4% (plateau) in europe, and 6
2% (decreasing) in north america
textiles  individuals allergic to dyes and permanent press and wash-and-wear chemicals added to textiles typically develop dermatitis on the trunk, which occurs maximally on the lateral sides of the trunk but spares the vault of the axillae
primary lesions may be small follicular papules or may be extensive plaques
individuals in whom this allergic contact dermatitis is suspected should be tested with a series of textile chemicals, particularly if routine patch testing reveals no allergy to formaldehyde
new clothing is most likely to provoke allergic contact dermatitis, since most allergens decrease in concentration in clothing following repeated washings
preservatives  preservative chemicals added to cosmetics, moisturizers, and topical medications are major causes of allergic contact dermatitis (see the image below)
the risk of allergic contact dermatitis appears to be highest to quaternium-15, followed by allergic contact dermatitis to isothiazolinones
methylisothiazolinone is used as an individual preservative and may be a significant allergen
kathon cg is methylchloroisothiazolinone in combination with methylisothiazolinone
although parabens are among the most widely used preservatives, they are not a frequent cause of allergic contact dermatitis
severe allergic contact dermatitis resulting from preservatives in sunscreen
patch testing was negative to the active ingredients in the sunscreen
schnuch et al estimated that preservatives found in leave-on topical products varied over 2 orders of magnitude in relative sensitization risk
formaldehyde is a major cause of allergic contact dermatitis (see the image below)
certain preservative chemicals widely used in shampoos, lotions, other moisturizers, and cosmetics are termed formaldehyde releasers (ie, quaternium-15 [dowicil 200], imidazolidinyl urea [germall 115], and isothiazolinones)
they are, in themselves, allergenic or may produce cross-sensitization to formaldehyde
onycholysis developing from allergic contact dermatitis to formaldehyde used to harden nails
fragrances  individuals may develop allergy to fragrances
fragrances are found not only in perfumes, colognes, aftershaves, deodorants, and soaps, but also in numerous other products, often as a mask to camouflage an unpleasant odor
unscented products may contain fragrance chemicals used as a component of the product and not labeled as fragrance
individuals allergic to fragrances should use fragrance-free products
unfortunately, the exact chemicals responsible for a fragrance in a product are not labeled
four thousand different fragrance molecules are available to formulate perfumes
the fragrance industry is not required to release the names of ingredients used to compose a fragrance in the united states, even when individuals develop allergic contact dermatitis to fragrances found in topical medications
deodorants may be the most common cause of allergic contact dermatitis to fragrances because they are applied to occlude skin that is often abraded by shaving in women
massage and physical therapists and geriatric nurses are at higher risk of occupational allergic contact dermatitis to fragrances
corticosteroids  in the last decade, it has become clear that some individuals with chronic dermatitis develop allergy to topical corticosteroids
most affected individuals can be treated with some topical corticosteroids, but an individual can be allergic to all topical and systemic corticosteroids
budesonide and tixocortol pivalate are useful patch test corticosteroids for identifying individuals allergic to topical corticosteroids
neomycin  the risk of allergy to neomycin is related directly to the extent of its use in a population
the risk of allergy to neomycin is much higher when it is used to treat chronic stasis dermatitis and venous ulcers than when it is used as a topical antibiotic on cuts and abrasions in children
assume that individuals allergic to neomycin are allergic to chemically related aminoglycoside antibiotics (eg, gentamicin, tobramycin)
avoid these drugs both topically and systemically in individuals allergic to neomycin
benzocaine  avoid topical use of benzocaine
benzocaine is included in most standard patch test trays
individuals allergic to benzocaine may safely use or be injected with lidocaine (xylocaine), which does not cross-react with benzocaine
sunscreens  many individuals complain of adverse reactions to sunscreens, but many of these individuals are not allergic to the sunscreen materials
they may be allergic to preservatives in these products or may have nonspecific cutaneous irritation from these products
photoallergy  occasionally, individuals develop photoallergic contact dermatitis
allergic contact dermatitis may be accentuated by ultraviolet (uv) light, or patients may develop an allergic reaction only when a chemical is present on the skin and when the skin is exposed sufficiently to ultraviolet light a (uv-a; 320-400 nm)
acrylates and methacrylates  these agents are used in manufacturing, nail acrylics, and wound dressings, among other uses
epidemiology   united states statistics  the national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes) estimated the prevalence of contact dermatitis to be 13
6 cases per 1000 population, using physical examinations by dermatologists of a selected sample of patients
nhanes underreported the prevalence compared with the physical examination findings
the national ambulatory medical care survey conducted in 1995 estimated 8
4 million outpatient visits to american physicians for contact dermatitis
this was the second most frequent dermatologic diagnosis
of office visits to dermatologists, 9% are for dermatitis
at a student health center dermatology clinic, 3
1% of patients presented for allergic contact dermatitis, and 2
3% presented for irritant contact dermatitis
the true test web site can provide accurate basic information on common allergens
the contact allergen management program is provided as a service to the american contact dermatitis society (acds) members and is particularly valuable for allergens found in topical skin care products
the contact allergen management program (camp) database contains more than 8100 known ingredients cataloged in more than 5500 commercial skincare products and is available as a smartphone application
international statistics  a swedish study found that prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis of the hands was 2
7 cases per 1000 population
a dutch study found that prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis of the hands was 12 cases per 1000 population
race, sex, and age-related demographics  no racial predilection exists for allergic contact dermatitis
allergic contact dermatitis is more common in women than in men
this predominantly is a result of allergy to nickel, which is much more common in women than in men in most countries
allergic contact dermatitis may occur in neonates
in elderly individuals, the development of allergic contact dermatitis may be delayed somewhat, but the dermatitis may be more persistent once developed
contact allergy to topical medicaments is more common in persons older than 70 years
prognosis  the prognosis depends on how well the affected individual can avoid the offending allergen
individuals with allergic contact dermatitis may have persistent or relapsing dermatitis, particularly if the material(s) to which they are allergic is not identified or if they continue to practice skin care that is no longer appropriate (ie, they continue to use harsh chemicals to wash their skin, they do not apply creams with ceramides or bland emollients to protect their skin)
the longer an individual has severe dermatitis, the longer it is believed it will take the dermatitis to resolve once the cause is identified
some individuals have persistent dermatitis following allergic contact dermatitis, which appears to be true especially in individuals allergic to chromates
a particular problem is neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus), in which individuals repeatedly rub or scratch an area initially affected by allergic contact dermatitis
mortality  death from allergic contact dermatitis is rare in the united states
allergic contact dermatitis to the weed wild feverfew caused deaths in india when the seeds contaminated wheat shipments to india
this plant then became widespread and a primary cause of severe airborne allergic contact dermatitis
patient education  patients have the best prognosis when they are able to remember the materials to which they are allergic and how to avoid further exposures
provide patients with as much information as possible concerning the chemical to which they are allergic, including all known names of the chemical
web sites, smartphone applications, standard textbooks, and the true test kit contain basic information about the chemicals
susceptible individuals need to read the list of ingredients before applying cosmetic products to their skin, since preservative chemicals are used widely in consumer, medical, and workplace products
the same chemical may have different names when used for consumer or industrial purposes
provide pamphlets with color pictures of poison ivy to individuals allergic to the plant
the american academy of dermatology also has pamphlets on allergic contact dermatitis and hand eczema
for patient education information, see the skin, hair, and nails center, as well as contact dermatitis
allergic fungal sinusitis
practice essentials  over the past few decades, allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) has become increasingly defined
historically mistaken for a paranasal sinus tumor, allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) now is believed to be an allergic reaction to aerosolized environmental fungi, usually of the dematiaceous species, in an immunocompetent host
this is in contrast to invasive fungal infections that affect immunocompromised hosts, such as patients with diabetes mellitus and patients with aids
most patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) have a history of allergic rhinitis, and the exact timing of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) development can be difficult to discern
thick fungal debris and mucin, as shown below, are developed in the sinus cavities and must be surgically removed so that the inciting allergen is no longer present
recurrence is not uncommon once the disease is removed, but anti-inflammatory medical therapy and immunotherapy are being employed to help prevent recurrence
left middle meatus with suctioning of thick allergic mucin from the ethmoid bulla in the center of the picture; the end of the suction is in the inferior portion of the picture
diagnosis  laboratory studies total immunoglobulin e (ige) values generally are elevated in allergic fungal sinusitis (afs), often to more than 1000 u/ml (normal values are <50 u/ml), and have been proposed as a useful indicator of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) clinical activity
patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) generally demonstrate positive skin tests and in vitro radioallergosorbent test (rast) responses to fungal and nonfungal antigens
preliminary information suggests that methods of quantitative skin testing (in vivo) may provide even greater sensitivity ratings than rast in patients with the disease
gell and coombs type i hypersensitivity in patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) can be demonstrated by elevation of serum total and fungal-specific ige and by positive skin test results for fungal and nonfungal antigens
however, this reaction does not appear to be fungal specific
ct scanning accumulation of allergic fungal mucin eventually leads to the increasingly well-recognized radiographic findings characteristic of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
heterogeneous areas of signal intensity within paranasal sinuses filled with allergic fungal mucin frequently are identified on computed tomography (ct) scans
expansion, remodeling, or thinning of involved sinus walls is common in allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) and is thought to be caused by the expansile nature of the accumulating mucin
areas of high attenuation are found within the expanded paranasal sinuses in all patients
similar radiographic findings can be caused by rare osteoid/chondroid matrix-producing sinonasal sarcomas or meningiomas
mri magnetic resonance imaging (mri) also can provide information useful in preoperative identification of allergic fungal mucin, but it usually is not necessary when making the diagnosis unless the disease has extended into the intracranial cavity or confusion exists with the diagnosis
histologic findings allergic fungal mucin normally is first encountered at surgery
therefore, recognition of its presence is the initial step in establishing an accurate diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
examination of mucosa and polyps obtained from involved paranasal sinuses reveals findings consistent with the inflammation of a chronic inflammatory process and should be performed to exclude fungal invasion
management  on the basis of a postulated schema of the pathophysiology of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs), a variety of treatment plans addressing its multiple contributing factors has emerged
medical control of the disease has made use of various combinations of antifungal medications, corticosteroids, and immunotherapy, with varying degrees of disease control
the invariable components of combination therapy still are surgical removal of the inciting fungal allergic mucin and marsupialization of the involved sinuses
for this reason, surgery has played an important role in the management of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) since its earliest reports
increased acceptance of specific immunologic hypersensitivity as the cause of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) has led to changes in its management
these changes have involved the medical and surgical arms of therapy
while systemic use of antifungal medications largely has been replaced by immunomodulation, radical surgery for allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) has given way to more conservative, tissue-sparing approaches
history of the procedure  several decades ago, fungal disease in the nose and paranasal sinuses represented an invasive deadly disease
management consisted of extensive surgical debridement followed by therapy with systemic and topical antifungal agents
early on, aspergillus, a fungus known to cause invasive disease in the sinuses, was the only fungus recovered from the paranasal sinuses in patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) because of the limitation of culture techniques and the lack of knowledge that dematiaceous fungi caused disease in the paranasal sinuses
therefore, the disease was treated aggressively
in 1976, safirstein noted that the combination of polyposis, crust formation, and sinus cultures yielding aspergillus was similar to the constellation of findings observed in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (abpa), a benign allergic process
safirstein's description was duplicated and expanded on by reports of allergic aspergillosis of the paranasal sinuses and allergic aspergillus sinusitis
in the late 1980s, the disease was more widely accepted as a benign fungal process and often confused with a paranasal sinus tumor on imaging studies because allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) creates expansion of affected sinus cavities
in 1989, robson et al introduced the term allergic fungal sinusitis following reports that this condition could be caused by a number of different fungi, not only aspergillus
although the disease is becoming more recognized, confusion remains regarding diagnosis and treatment
problem  no consensus exists among rhinologists concerning diagnostic criteria for allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
several authors have made observations
in 1991, allphin and colleagues described certain features that they felt differentiated allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) from other forms of fungal sinusitis, including radiographic presence of multiple opacified paranasal sinuses, characteristic histologic findings of allergic mucin, and laboratory evidence of  allergy
in 1993, loury and schaefer proposed multiple diagnostic criteria, including eosinophilia, immediate skin reactivity or serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies to fungal antigen, elevated total immunoglobulin e (ige) level, nasal mucosal edema or polyposis, histopathologic findings of allergic mucin containing noninvasive fungal hyphae, and characteristic ct or mri findings
in 1994, in reporting the mayo clinic experience, cody et al simplified the diagnostic criteria to include only characteristic allergic mucin and either noninvasive fungal hyphae within the collected mucin or positive fungal cultures
in 1994, bent and kuhn described what probably are the most widely accepted criteria for diagnosis
on the basis of the analysis of 15 cases, 5 common characteristics were observed, including gell and coombs type i (ige-mediated) hypersensitivity to fungi, nasal polyposis, characteristic radiographic findings, eosinophilic mucin without fungal invasion into sinus tissue, and positive fungal stain of sinus contents removed at the time of surgery
in 1997, deshazo proposed a similar set of 5 criteria, including radiographic evidence of sinusitis, presence of allergic mucin (identified grossly or histopathologically), positive fungal stain or culture from the sinus at the time of surgery, absence of contributory factors (eg, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiencies), and absence of fungal invasion
a positive fungal culture does not confirm the diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs), nor does a negative culture exclude it
for example, fungi may proliferate as saprophytic growth in diseased sinuses
furthermore, mycology laboratories vary in capability, and specimen handling significantly influences the rate of positive fungal cultures in a clinical setting
allergic mucin remains the most reliable indicator of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
because nasal polyposis and fungal disease in the sinuses are not unique to (afs), other mycotic diseases in the differential diagnosis must be defined and include the following:  invasive fungal sinusitis: this condition typically is encountered in patients who are immunocompromised or have diabetes mellitus and is characterized by angioinvasive fungal penetration of tissue
hypesthesia, local pain, and intranasal necrosis (in an immunocompromised person) strongly suggest invasive fungal sinusitis and help to differentiate this disease from allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
saprophytic fungal growth: this growth may be found in one or more paranasal sinus cavities of patients who have chronic suppurative rhinosinusitis
similar growth may occur within nasal debris of patients who have undergone aggressive sinonasal surgery or those who have rhinitis sicca
although fungal cultures may be positive, the absence of gross and histiologic findings of allergic mucin and the lack of clinical manifestations of invasive fungal sinusitis suggest saprophytic fungal growth
mycetoma, aspergilloma, or fungus ball of the sinuses: this clinical entity differs from allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) in presentation
rather than involving multiple sinuses, a fungus ball typically involves a single sinus, most often the maxillary antrum or sphenoid
patients affected by this condition are not necessarily allergic and generally do not exhibit nasal polyps
on histologic examination, the material removed from the sinuses demonstrates only fungal hyphae without eosinophils
surgery in such patients generally is curative
eosinophilic mucin sinusitis: pansinusitis, polyposis, and mucin that is clinically indistinguishable from that of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) are characteristic
however, examination of mucin reveals no fungal hyphae
allergy is not as constant a feature in this condition as it is in allergic fungal sinusitis (afs), but asthma is observed more frequently
ferguson has suggested that this condition may represent a variant of the samter triad
epidemiology   frequency  approximately 5-10% of patients affected by chronic rhinosinusitis actually carry a diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
atopy is characteristic of the disease; approximately two thirds of patients report a history of allergic rhinitis, and 90% of patients demonstrate elevated specific ige to one or more fungal antigens
approximately 50% of patients in a series by manning et al had asthma
no linkage to aspirin sensitivity has been established
incidence of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) appears to be impacted by geographic factors
review of world literature reveals that most sites reporting cases of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) are located in temperate regions of relatively high humidity
however, incidence of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) varied remarkably based on the location of reporting sites
allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) in the united states was encountered most commonly within the mississippi basin, the southeast, and the southwest
the reason for this geographic difference remains unexplained
allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) is most common among adolescents and young adults; the mean age at diagnosis is 21
9 years
the male-to-female (m/f) ratio of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) differs slightly between published reports but is believed to be equal when all ages are evaluated together
a literature review of 98 cases in the 1980s and early 1990s from 29 published journal articles reported an equal m/f incidence
a review by the author and colleagues of 151 patients at the university of texas (ut) at southwestern also revealed an equal m/f ratio, with ages ranging from 5-75 years
however, the m/f ratio may be age dependent and different in children and adults
in the review of patients at ut southwestern, in children, males dominated (m/f ratio 2
1:1; average age, 13 y), and in adults, females dominated (m/f ratio 1:1
4; average age, 36 y)
when evaluating the average ages and sex ratios of other studies, series with younger average ages are more likely to have a male predominance
the average ages in the male-dominated series were 25 and 27 years, while the average age in the female-dominated series was 33 years
the only other pediatric series consisted of 10 patients and had an m/f ratio of 1
5:1, with a mean age of 13
6 years
interestingly, when 2 series of patients from a single institution were reviewed over time, an early study had an m/f ratio of 1
5:1, with an age range of 13-51 years (average age, 27
5 y), and a later review had an m/f ratio of 1:1
4, with an age range of 13-69 years (no average age given)
etiology  most rhinologists believe that allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) is an allergic reaction to fungi, in which fungal debris, allergic mucin, and nasal polyposes are formed in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses
the causative fungi in allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) are usually dematiaceous fungi, consisting of the genera bipolaris, curvularia, exserohilum, alternaria, drechslera, helminthosporium, and fusarium, with a small component of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) caused by aspergillus
in a 1996 review of english literature performed by manning, 263 cases of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) were identified, of which 168 cases yielded positive fungal cultures
of these 168 positive cultures, 87% were from the dematiaceous genera, while only 13% yielded aspergillus
the largest reported single institutional experience to date is at the ut southwestern medical center in dallas, texas
the fungi recovered from the paranasal sinuses in that evaluation by the author and colleagues revealed that bipolaris, followed by curvularia, is the most common pathogen present, seen with similar incidence in adults and children, see table 1 below
most large reviews agree, indicating that bipolaris and curvularia species are the most common fungi recovered
when geographic location is specifically reviewed, the further west and inland the series, the more likely that bipolaris species dominated the fungi recovered
when the series was performed in the southeast, curvularia species were more likely to be recovered
interestingly, in the ut southwestern experience, aspergillus was recovered in 13% of adults but in no children
a report from india found only aspergillus species identified in all 11 patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) in whom fungus was recovered
table 1
causative fungus identified at ut southwestern medical center (open table in a new window) controversy has existed over whether the disease is infectious or allergic
manning and holman objectively addressed this controversy in 2 separate studies
in the first study, 8 patients with culture-positive bipolaris allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) were prospectively compared with 10 control subjects who did not have allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
both groups were evaluated with (1) radioallergosorbent test (rast) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) inhibition to bipolaris -specific ige and igg antibodies and (2) skin testing with bipolaris antigen
all 8 patients had positive skin test reactions to bipolaris antigen and positive rast and elisa inhibition to bipolaris -specific ige and igg
eight of the 10 control subjects had negative results on both skin and serologic testing, implicating the importance of allergy to fungal antigens (both in vivo and in vitro) in the pathophysiology of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
in a complementary study, sinus mucosal specimens from 14 patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) were compared with those from 10 control subjects who did not have allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
immunohistochemical analysis for eosinophilic mediators (major basic protein and eosinophilic-derived neurotoxin) and a neutrophil-derived mediator (neutrophil elastase) was performed to assess the underlying nature of inflammation
eosinophilic-derived mediators were much more common (p< 0
00001) than neutrophil-derived mediators in the allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) group, whereas significant differences were not observed in the control group
the predominance of eosinophilic-derived mediators further supports the association between noninfectious (ie, allergic) inflammation and allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
the concept of eosinophilic activation associated with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) was further emphasized by feger et al, who studied eosinophilic cationic protein levels in the serum and mucin of patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
no differences in serum eosinophilic cationic protein were detected between patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) and control subjects, but eosinophilic cationic protein levels were significantly higher in the mucin of patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs); p < 0
01)
studies such as those by manning et al and feger et al offer strong immunologic and histologic data to support the argument that allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) represents an immunologically mediated disorder rather than a point on the spectrum of infectious fungal disease
a study by lu-myers et al found that socioeconomic factors differed between patients with allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and those with chronic rhinosinusitis, with the latter tending to be white and older, with a higher income and greater access to primary care
the study, which involved a total of 186 patients (93 patients in each group), also found that patients with allergic fungal rhinosinusitis tended to have greater quantitative serum ige levels and higher lund-mackay scale scores than did patients with chronic rhinosinusitis
a study by mostafa et al found serum levels of vitamin d3 to be significantly lower in patients with allergic fungal rhinosinusitis than in controls
the investigators suggest that the agent may serve as a prophylactic against the disease
the study included 25 patients with allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and 19 controls
pathophysiology  currently, the pathophysiology of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) is postulated to be similar to that of allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease (a term replacing bronchopulmonary aspergillosis)
manning and colleagues have suggested that several interrelated factors and events lead to the development and perpetuation of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
first, an atopic host is exposed to fungi, theoretically via normal nasal respiration, which provides the initial antigenic stimulus
an initial inflammatory response ensues as the result of both a gell and coombs type i (ige-mediated) and type iii (immune complex–mediated) reaction, causing subsequent tissue edema
the resulting obstruction of sinus ostia, which may be accentuated by anatomic factors such as septal deviation or turbinate hypertrophy, results in stasis within the sinuses
this creates an ideal environment for further proliferation of the fungus, thus increasing the antigenic exposure to which the host is allergic
at some point, the cycle becomes self-perpetuating, resulting in the eventual product of this process, allergic mucin, the material that fills the involved sinuses of patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
accumulation of this debris obstructs the involved sinuses and propagates the process
the production of this allergic mucin and its eventual clinical, histologic, and radiographic characteristics are unique to allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) and serve as a hallmark of the disease
grossly, allergic fungal mucin is thick, tenacious, and highly viscous
its color may vary from light tan to brown or dark green, as depicted in the images below
its characteristic gross appearance has resulted in the use of such descriptive terms as peanut butter and axle grease when referring to allergic fungal mucin

in a study of 74 patients, white et al indicated that in cases of allergic fungal sinusitis, younger patients and african americans are more likely to suffer bony erosion, suggesting that these individuals have a more severe inflammatory response in the disease
presentation  patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) normally present with signs and symptoms of nasal airway obstruction, allergic rhinitis, or chronic sinusitis that includes nasal congestion, purulent rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, or headaches
often, presentation of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) is subtle
patients typically complain of gradual nasal airway obstruction and production of semi-solid nasal crusts that, upon inquiry, match the gross description of allergic fungal mucin
development of nasal airway obstruction may have been so gradual that the patient is unaware of its presence
because of the slow progression of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs), if facial dysmorphia is present, its progression often is so slow that it is unrecognized by the patient and family members
pain is uncommon among patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) and suggests the concomitant presence of a bacterial rhinosinusitis
patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) are atopic, but generally their symptoms have been unresponsive to antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, and prior immunotherapy
use of systemic corticosteroids may produce some relief of symptoms, but relapse is typical following completion of therapy
in contrast to patients who have invasive fungal sinusitis, patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) always are immunocompetent
the range of physical findings on examination is typically broad, from nasal airway obstruction resulting from intranasal inflammation and polyposis, as depicted in the 1st image below, to gross facial disfigurement and orbital or ocular abnormalities
the author and colleagues reported that facial dysmorphism, consisting of proptosis, as depicted in the 2nd image below, telecanthus, and malar flattening, more often was seen in children than in adults (42% vs 10%) in their series of 151 patients, including 107 adults aged 18 years or older and 44 children aged 17 years or younger, as depicted in table 2 below

a 9-year-old girl with allergic fungal sinusitis displaying telecanthus and asymmetrical positioning of her eyes and globes
usually, when proptosis was present in patients in this study, telecanthus and malar flattening could be identified, as depicted in the 1st image above, depending on the amount of proptosis
because development of proptosis usually occurs over long periods, no diplopia or visual loss generally is seen
however, at times, extension of allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) into adjacent anatomic spaces can produce a dramatic clinical presentation, such as visual loss
visual loss from allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) caused by compression of the ophthalmic nerve, described by marple et al in 3 of 82 patients he encountered, was reversible with immediate surgical removal of fungal disease
return occurred over weeks to months
a study by gupta et al indicated that allergic fungal rhinosinusitis tends to be more severe when granulomas are present
the study involved 57 patients with allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, including nine patients with granulomas, with the investigators finding that those with granulomas had a tendency toward orbital and skull base erosion, as well as telecanthus, diplopia, exophthalmos, and facial pain
table 2
facial asymmetry characteristics (open table in a new window)  indications  all patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs) should undergo surgical debridement of their sinuses
the inciting fungal antigen must be removed for immunotherapy to be successful
any recurrent disease also should be surgically removed
relevant anatomy  relevant anatomy is the same as in any endoscopic sinus surgery procedure
often, anatomy is distorted because of expansion of the sinuses secondary to the disease process
the lateral nasal wall is pushed medially, obliterating the nasal cavity on the affected side, and the inferior and middle turbinates are pushed inferomedially, as depicted in the 1st two images below
if the ethmoid sinuses are involved, the roof often is expanded superiorly into the anterior cranial fossa, and the lateral wall is expanded into the orbit, as depicted in the last image below

contraindications  no specific contraindications exist to surgical removal of fungal debris and polyps in patients with allergic fungal sinusitis (afs)
normally, these patients are healthy immunocompetent individuals
berloque dermatitis
background  berloque dermatitis obtains its name from the german word berlock or the french berloque, meaning trinket or charm
rosenthalcoined the term in 1925 to describe pendantlike streaks of pigmentation on the neck, face, arms, or trunk
he suspected they were due to fluid droplets, unaware that freundin 1916 had described hyperpigmented macules due to sun exposure after the application of eau de cologne
the phototoxic ingredient causing the pigmentation proved to be bergapten, a component of oil of bergamot, derived from the rind of citrus bergamia, the bergamot lime
several cases were reported in the 1950s and 1960s following increased use of perfumes containing oil of bergamot and the passion for sunbathing
since the introduction of artificial oil of bergamot and the reduced use of the natural product in perfumes, berloque dermatitis has become rare
note the image below
hyperpigmented streaks on the dorsa of hands of a patient with bergapten phototoxicity      pathophysiology  phototoxicity or photoirritation is a chemically induced nonimmunologic acute skin irritation requiring light (usually within the uva spectrum, ie, 320-400 nm)
the skin response resembles exaggerated sunburn and does not require prior sensitization; it can be caused by a single simultaneous exposure to the chemical and light source
the photoactive chemical may enter the skin via topical administration, or via ingestion, inhalation, or parenteral administration
the reaction can be evoked in all subjects as long as the concentration of the chemical and the dose of light are sufficient
for a discussion of phototoxicty, there are several recent reviews
in the case of berloque dermatitis, the phototoxic reaction is induced by the effect of long-wave ultraviolet (uva) radiation on bergapten, or 5-methoxypsoralens, a furocoumarin now known to be the only photoactive component of bergamot oil (see the image below)
the bergapten-uva radiation combination induces an intensification of melanogenesis and a corresponding increase in the number of functional melanocytes, which are more dendritic and dopa-positive
the distribution of melanosomes in keratinocyte changes from the aggregate to nonaggregate form
molecular structure of 5-methoxypsoralen (bergapten)    epidemiology   frequency  the exact incidence of berloque dermatitis is unknown
in the untied states, berloque dermatitis now is exceedingly rare due to the use of bergapten-free fragrance formulations
the us hazardous substances act issued regulations stating that products containing oil of bergamot must not exceed 62 ppm bergapten, 2% bergamot oil
following work performed by marzulli and maibachand reported in 1970, even lower concentrations than this have been recommended (< 0
3% bergamot oil, equivalent to 0
001% bergapten), and bergapten-free bergamot oil is used almost always now in the untied states
however, in some countries where bergamot oil continues to be used, berloque dermatitis remains a problem
even in the untied states, milder forms still are being observed
recently, a patient was reported to have severe berloque dermatitis due to using a suntan booth immediately after applying some 40-year-old shalimar perfume, which contained bergamot oil
apart from the bergamot lime, bergapten also is a component in other substances, inducing bergapten phototoxicity without the typical pendantlike appearance of berloque dermatitis
for instance, in norway, bergapten phototoxicity has been reported due to heracleum laciniatum and in denmark due to heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed)
race  precise information about racial predilection is not available
sex  berloque dermatitis usually occurs in females who wear fragrances containing oil of bergamot, but males who wear fragrances or fragrance-containing products, such as aftershave lotion, also may develop berloque dermatitis
age  berloque dermatitis usually occurs in women, although it can occur in persons of any age who apply fragrances containing oil of bergamot
delayed hypersensitivity reactions
background  delayed hypersensitivity reactions are inflammatory reactions initiated by mononuclear leukocytes
the term delayed is used to differentiate a secondary cellular response, which appears 48-72 hours after antigen exposure, from an immediate hypersensitivity response, which generally appears within 12 minutes of an antigen challenge
these reactions are mediated by t cells and monocytes/macrophages rather than by antibodies
they are also termed type iv hypersensitivity reactions
delayed hypersensitivity is a major mechanism of defense against various intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria, fungi, and certain parasites, and it occurs in transplant rejection and tumor immunity
the central role of cd4 t cells in delayed hypersensitivity is illustrated in patients with aids
because of the loss of cd4 cells, the host response against intracellular pathogens such as mycobacterium tuberculosis is markedly impaired
the bacteria are engulfed by macrophages but are not killed
if t-cell function is abnormal, the patient presents with opportunistic infections, including infection with mycobacteria, fungi, parasites, and, often, mucocutaneous candidiasis
undesirable consequences of delayed-type hypersensitivity (dth) reactions include illness such as contact dermatitis and allograft rejection
examples of dth reactions are contact dermatitis (eg, poison ivy rash), tuberculin skin test reactions, granulomatous inflammation (eg, sarcoidosis, crohn disease), allograft rejection, graft versus host disease, and autoimmune hypersensitivity reactions
of note, the rhus genus of plants, which includes poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac, all cause identical rashes
pathophysiology  the cellular events that result in delayed hypersensitivity reactions primarily involve t cells and macrophages
first, local immune and inflammatory responses at the site of foreign antigen up-regulate endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression, promoting the accumulation of leukocytes at the tissue site
the antigen is engulfed by macrophages and monocytes and is processed and presented to a t cell that has a specific receptor for that processed antigen
macrophages secrete interleukin (il)–1, il-2, il-6, and other lymphokines
cytotoxic t cells can also be activated
the recruited macrophages can form giant cells
the characteristic histologic appearance of the macrophage–t-cell infiltrate is a granuloma
this type of infiltrate in the tissue is called granulomatous inflammation
several variants of dth exist, and their precise pathophysiologic mechanisms are slightly different
for example, in contact hypersensitivity reactions, the epidermis is involved; in pulmonary tuberculosis (tb), lung tissue is involved
epidemiology   frequency  dth reactions are extremely common
persons of any age can be affected, but infants may not have the fully-developed immune capability to elicit a reaction
mortality/morbidity  delayed hypersensitivity reactions are normal physiological events
anything that alters these normal events can lead to multiple opportunistic infections
dth reactions may include, but are not limited to, contact dermatitis (eg, poison ivy rash), tuberculin skin test reactions, granulomatous inflammation (eg, sarcoidosis, crohn disease), allograft rejection, graft versus host disease, and autoimmune hypersensitivity reactions
morbidity and mortality vary (eg, ranging from a rash to chronic debilitating diseases) based on the active disease present
drug eruptions
practice essentials  drug eruptions can mimic a wide range of dermatoses
the morphologies are myriad and include morbilliform (see the image below), urticarial, papulosquamous, pustular, and bullous
medications can also cause pruritus and dysesthesia without an obvious eruption
a drug-induced reaction should be considered in any patient who is taking medications and who suddenly develops a symmetric cutaneous eruption
morbilliform drug eruption
signs and symptoms  the first steps in the history are as follows:  review the patient’s complete medication list, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs document any history of previous adverse reactions to drugs or foods consider alternative etiologies (eg, viral exanthems and bacterial infections) note any concurrent infections, metabolic disorders, or immunocompromise in addition, the following should be noted and detailed:  interval between introduction of a drug and onset of the eruption route, dose, duration, and frequency of drug administration use of parenterally administered drugs (more likely to cause anaphylaxis) use of topically applied drugs (more likely to induce delayed-type hypersensitivity) use of multiple courses of therapy and prolonged administration (risk of allergic sensitization) any improvement after drug withdrawal and any reaction with readministration physical examination should address clinical features that may indicate a severe, potentially life-threatening drug reaction, including the following:  mucous membrane erosions blisters nikolsky sign confluent erythema angioedema and tongue swelling palpable purpura skin necrosis lymphadenopathy high fever, dyspnea, or hypotension it is important to appreciate the morphology and physical features of drug eruptions, as follows:  acneiform acral erythema (erythrodysesthesia) agep dermatomyositislike dress erythema multiforme (em), including em minor, sjs, ten, and sjs/ten overlap erythema nodosum erythroderma fixed drug eruptions hypersensitivity syndrome leukocytoclastic vasculitis lichenoid lupus morbilliform or exanthematous pseudoporphyria   serum sickness and serum sickness–like sweet syndrome ( acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) urticaria vesiculobullous see clinical presentation for more detail
diagnosis  with mild asymptomatic eruptions, the history and physical examination are often sufficient for diagnosis; with severe or persistent eruptions, further diagnostic testing may be required, as follows:  biopsy complete blood count (cbc) with differential serum chemistry studies (especially for electrolyte balance and indices of renal or hepatic function in patients with severe reactions) antibody or immunoserology tests direct cultures to investigate a primary infectious etiology or secondary infection urinalysis, stool guaiac tests, and chest radiography for vasculitis skin prick or patch testing to confirm the causative agent see workup for more detail
management  principles of medical care are as follows:  the ultimate goal is to identify and discontinue the offending medication if possible patients can sometimes continue to be treated through morbilliform eruptions; nevertheless, all patients with severe morbilliform eruptions should be monitored for mucous membrane lesions, blistering, and skin sloughing treatment of a drug eruption depends on the specific type of reaction therapy for exanthematous drug eruptions is supportive, involving the administration of oral antihistamines, topical steroids, and moisturizing lotions severe reactions (eg, sjs, ten, and hypersensitivity reactions) warrant hospital admission ten is best managed in a burn unit, and intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) may improve outcomes    hypersensitivity syndrome may have to be treated with liver transplantation if the offending drug is not stopped in time; treatment with systemic corticosteroids has been advocated in the acute phase; in the chronic phase, patients may require treatment for hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus for most drug eruptions, full recovery without any complications is expected; however, the following should be noted:  patients with exanthematous eruptions should expect mild desquamation as the rash resolves patients with hypersensitivity syndrome are at risk of becoming hypothyroid, usually within the first 4-12 weeks after the reaction; there is also a risk of diabetes the prognosis for patients with ten is guarded; scarring, blindness, and death are possible see treatment and medication for more detail
background  drug eruptions can mimic a wide range of dermatoses
the morphologies are myriad and include morbilliform (most common, see image below), urticarial, papulosquamous, pustular, and bullous
medications can also cause pruritus and dysesthesia without an obvious eruption
both calcium channel blockers and interferon are strongly associated with eczematous eruptions
morbilliform drug eruption
a drug-induced reaction should be considered in any patient who is taking medications and who suddenly develops a symmetric cutaneous eruption
medications that are known for causing cutaneous reactions include antimicrobial agents,nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), cytokines, chemotherapeutic agents, anticonvulsants, and psychotropic agents
prompt identification and withdrawal of the offending agent may help limit the toxic effects associated with the drug
the decision to discontinue a potentially vital drug often presents a dilemma
pathophysiology  drug eruptions may be divided into immunologically and nonimmunologically mediated reactions
immunologically mediated reactions  coombs and gell proposed four types of immunologically mediated reactions, as follows:  type i is immunoglobulin e (ige)–dependent reactions, which result in urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis (see the image below)
urticaria
type ii is cytotoxic reactions, which result in hemolysis and purpura (see the image below)
oral ulcerations in a patient receiving cytotoxic therapy
type iii is immune complex reactions, which result in vasculitis, serum sickness, and urticaria
type iv is delayed-type reactions with cell-mediated hypersensitivity, which result in contact dermatitis, exanthematous reactions, and photoallergic reactions
th17 t cells are implicated in many drug eruptions, and sulfamethoxazole induces a t-cell switch mechanism based on the tcrvβ20-1 domain altering peptide-hla recognition
in severe drug reactions, micro rna-18a-5p down-regulates the expression of the antiapoptotic b-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2–like protein 10 (bcl2l10), promoting apoptosis
insulin and other proteins are associated with type i reactions
penicillin, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, and rifampin are known to cause type ii reactions
quinine, salicylates, chlorpromazine, and sulfonamides can cause type iii reactions
type iv reactions, the most common mechanism of drug eruptions, are often encountered in cases of contact hypersensitivity to topical medications, such as neomycin
sulfonamides are most frequently associated with toxic epidermal necrolysis (ten)
although most drug eruptions are type iv hypersensitivity reactions, only a minority are ige-dependent
that is, antibodies can be demonstrated in less than 5% of cutaneous drug reactions
type iv cell-mediated reactions are not dose dependent, they usually begin 7-20 days after the medication is started, they may involve blood or tissue eosinophilia, and they may recur if drugs chemically related to the causative agent are administered
nonimmunologically mediated reactions  nonimmunologically mediated reactions may be classified according to the following features: accumulation, adverse effects, direct release of mast cell mediators, idiosyncratic reactions, intolerance, jarisch-herxheimer phenomenon, overdosage, or phototoxic dermatitis
(symptoms of jarisch-herxheimer reactions disappear with continued therapy
drug therapy should be continued until the infection is fully eradicated
) an example of accumulation is argyria (blue-gray discoloration of skin and nails) observed with use of silver nitrate nasal sprays
adverse effects are normal but unwanted effects of a drug
for example, antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide, are associated with hair loss
the direct release of mast cell mediators is a dose-dependent phenomenon that does not involve antibodies
for example, aspirin and other nsaids cause a shift in leukotriene production, which triggers the release of histamine and other mast-cell mediators
radiographic contrast material, alcohol, cytokines, opiates, cimetidine, quinine, hydralazine, atropine, vancomycin, and tubocurarine also may cause release of mast-cell mediators
idiosyncratic reactions are unpredictable and not explained by the pharmacologic properties of the drug
an example is the individual with infectious mononucleosis who develops a rash when given ampicillin
imbalance of endogenous flora may occur when antimicrobial agents preferentially suppress the growth of one species of microbe, allowing other species to grow vigorously
for example, candidiasis frequently occurs with antibiotic therapy
intolerance may occur in patients with altered metabolism
for example, individuals who are slow acetylators of the enzyme n -acetyltransferase are more likely than others to develop drug-induced lupus in response to procainamide
jarisch-herxheimer phenomenon is a reaction due to bacterial endotoxins and microbial antigens that are liberated by the destruction of microorganisms
the reaction is characterized by fever, tender lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, transient macular or urticarial eruptions, and exacerbation of preexisting cutaneous lesions
the reaction is not an indication to stop treatment because symptoms resolve with continued therapy
this reaction can be seen with penicillin therapy for syphilis, griseofulvin or ketoconazole therapy for dermatophyte infections, and diethylcarbamazine therapy for oncocerciasis
overdosage is an exaggerated response to an increased amount of a medication
for example, increased doses of anticoagulants may result in purpura
phototoxic dermatitis is an exaggerated sunburn response caused by the formation of toxic photoproducts, such as free radicals or reactive oxygen species (see the image below)
phototoxic reaction after use of a tanning booth
note sharp cutoff where clothing blocked exposure
epidemiology   united states  drug eruptions occur in approximately 2-5% of inpatients and in greater than 1% of outpatients
international  drug eruptions occur in approximately 2-3% of inpatients
sex  adverse cutaneous reactions to drugs are more prevalent in women than in men
age  elderly patients have an increased prevalence of adverse drug reactions
prognosis  most drug eruptions are mild, self-limited, and usually resolve after the offending agent has been discontinued
even after the responsible agent is discontinued, drug eruptions may clear slowly or worsen over the next few days
the degree of eosinophilia is predictive of the severity of the drug eruption
the time required for total clearing may be 1-2 weeks or longer
severe and potentially life-threatening eruptions occur in approximately 1 in 1000 hospital patients
mortality rates for erythema multiforme (em) major are significantly higher
stevens-johnson syndrome (sjs) has a mortality rate of less than 5%, whereas the rate for ten approaches 20-30%; most patients die from sepsis
patients with exanthematous eruptions should be counseled to expect mild desquamation as the rash resolves
patients with hypersensitivity syndrome are at risk of becoming hypothyroid, usually within the first 4-12 weeks after the reaction
the prognosis for patients with ten is guarded
scarring, blindness, and death are possible
patient education  if the responsible drug is identified, advise the patient to avoid that drug in the future
clearly label the medical record
advise patients to carry a card or some other form of emergency identification in their wallets that lists drug allergies and/or intolerances, especially if they have had a severe reaction
advise patients about drugs that are cross-reactive and about drugs that must be avoided
for example, penicillin allergy reactions have cross-reactivity with cephalosporins, phenytoin hypersensitivity syndrome has cross-reactivity with phenobarbital and carbamazepine, and sulfonamide reactions cross-react with other sulfa-containing drugs
for patient education resources, see the allergy center
drug-induced photosensitivity
background  drug-induced photosensitivity refers to the development of cutaneous disease as a result of the combined effects of a chemical and light
exposure to either the chemical or the light alone is not sufficient to induce the disease; however, when photoactivation of the chemical occurs, one or more cutaneous manifestations may arise
these include phototoxic and photoallergic reactions, a planus lichenoides reaction, pseudoporphyria, and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus
photosensitivity reactions may result from systemic medications and topically applied compounds (see table 1 below)
uv-a–associated phototoxicity is also common with vemurafenib,with reduced uv-a minimal erythema dose in 94% of those tested
wavelengths within the uv-a (320-400 nm) range and, for certain compounds, within the visible range, are more likely to cause drug-induced photosensitivity reactions, although occasionally uv-b (290-320 nm) can also be responsible for such effects
uv-b wavelengths are most efficient at causing sunburn and nonmelanoma skin cancer
in patients who present with photosensitivity, it is often difficult to differentiate phototoxic from photoallergic reactions
however, they have a number of distinguishing characteristics (see table 2 below)
table 1
common photosensitizing medications (open table in a new window) phototoxic reactions occur because of the damaging effects of light-activated compounds on cell membranes and, in some instances, dna
by contrast, photoallergic reactions are cell-mediated immune responses to a light-activated compound
phototoxic reactions develop in most individuals if they are exposed to sufficient amounts of light and drug
typically, they appear as an exaggerated sunburn response, as shown in the image below
phototoxic reaction
photoallergic reactions resemble allergic contact dermatitis, with a distribution limited to sun-exposed areas of the body
however, when the reactions are severe or prolonged, they may extend into covered areas of skin
table 2
distinguishing characteristics of phototoxic and photoallergic reactions (open table in a new window)   photoallergic reactions develop in only a minority of individuals exposed to the compound and light; they are less prevalent than phototoxic skin reactions
the amount of drug required to elicit photoallergic reactions is considerably smaller than that required for phototoxic reactions
moreover, photoallergic reactions, as shown in the image below, are a form of cell-mediated immunity; their onset often is delayed by as long as 24-72 hours after exposure to the drug and light
by contrast, phototoxic responses often occur within minutes or hours of light exposure
photoallergic reaction
pathophysiology   phototoxicity  phototoxic reactions result from direct damage to tissue caused by a photoactivated compound
many compounds have the potential to cause phototoxicity
most have at least one resonating double bond or an aromatic ring that can absorb radiant energy
most compounds are activated by wavelengths within the uv-a (320-400 nm) range, although some compounds have a peak absorption within the uv-b or visible range
in most instances, photoactivation of a compound results in the excitation of electrons from the stable singlet state to an excited triplet state
as excited-state electrons return to a more stable configuration, they transfer their energy to oxygen, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates
reactive oxygen intermediates such as an oxygen singlet, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide damage cell membranes and dna
signal transduction pathways that lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and arachidonic acid metabolites are also activated
the result is an inflammatory response that has the clinical appearance of an exaggerated sunburn reaction
the exception to this mechanism of drug-induced phototoxicity is psoralen-induced phototoxicity
psoralens intercalate within dna, forming monofunctional adducts
exposure to uv-a radiation produces bifunctional adducts within dna
exactly how bifunctional adducts cause photosensitivity is unknown
photoallergic reactions  photoallergic reactions are cell-mediated immune responses in which the antigen is a light-activated drug
photoactivation results in the development of a metabolite that can bind to protein carriers in the skin to form a complete antigen
the reaction then proceeds exactly as other cell-mediated immune responses do
specifically, langerhans cells and other antigen-presenting cells take up the antigen and then migrate to regional lymph nodes
in those locations, the langerhans cells present the photoallergen to t lymphocytes that express antigen-specific receptors
the t cells become activated and proliferate, and they return to the site of photoallergen deposition
in the skin, the t cells orchestrate an inflammatory response that usually has an eczematous morphology if the photoallergen is applied topically or the characteristics of a drug eruption if the photoallergen is administered systemically
epidemiology   frequency  united states the incidence of drug-induced photosensitivity in the united states is uncertain
phototoxic reactions are considerably more common than photoallergic reactions
international the incidence of drug-induced photosensitivity is unknown
race  the racial incidence of drug-induced photosensitivity reactions is unknown
photosensitivity reactions can occur in races with heavily pigmented skin
sex  men are more likely to have photoallergic reactions than women
age  drug-induced photosensitivity reactions can occur in persons of any age
prognosis  in most patients, the prognosis is excellent once the offending agent is removed
however, complete resolution of the photosensitivity may take several weeks to months with some compounds
occasionally, patients have persistent light reactivity for which the prospects for resolution are poor
drug-induced photosensitivity is associated with death only in rare individuals who are exposed to large amounts of sunlight after taking large doses of psoralens
although mortality is rare, drug-induced photosensitivity can cause significant morbidity in some individuals, who must severely limit their exposure to natural or artificial light
voriconazole photosensitivity is associated with a risk of skin cancer
the changes that occur with long-term exposure resemble accelerated photo-aging
acute photosensitivity occurs in 1–2% or more of patients taking voriconazole for more than 12 weeks
it appears to be uv-a induced, but it is not strictly dose-dependent
cheilitis and facial erythema are typical initial manifestations
patient education  patients need to be counseled regarding the possible photosensitizing properties of both prescription and nonprescription medications
most often, appropriate sun protection measures prevent drug-induced photosensitivity reactions
for patient education resources, see the burns center, as well as sunburn
drug-induced pigmentation
background  adverse cutaneous reactions to medications are a common reason for consultations with dermatologists
drug-induced skin disorders may manifest in a variety of ways
drugs may cause exanthems, urticaria, hypersensitivity syndromes, pustular eruptions, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, cutaneous necrosis, and abnormal pigmentation of the skin and mucosa
although pigmentary changes caused by drugs usually result in a limited degree of morbidity, these changes may be very disturbing to the patient
the image below depicts a patient with amiodarone pigmentation
amiodarone pigmentation
drug-induced pigmentary abnormalities may be classified into 3 groups, which are (1) hyperpigmentation/melanosis, (2) hypopigmentation/leukoderma, and (3) dyspigmentation or occurrence of unusual skin color
a related article is fixed drug eruptions
additionally, the medscape adverse drug event reporting resource center may be of interest
pathophysiology  multiple pathologic mechanisms are responsible for drug-induced pigmentation disorders
compared with the immunological etiology underlying many drug allergies, most cases of pharmacologic pigmentation are not immunologically mediated
the pathogenesis underlying drug-related dyspigmentation can also be categorized into 3 mechanisms, which are (1) drug or drug metabolite deposition in the dermis and epidermis, (2) enhanced melanin production with or without an increase in the number of active melanocytes, and (3) drug-induced postinflammatory changes to skin
similarly, chemical hypopigmentation is also thought to occur through a variety of pathologic mechanisms, including a reduced number of skin melanocytes, enzymatic blockade of melanogenesis, and inhibition of melanosome transfer
epidemiology   frequency  united states the rate of drug-induced dyspigmentation varies depending on the drug and cumulative dose
some drugs, such as amiodarone, have been reported to have a rate of blue-gray dyspigmentation as high as 24% when the cumulative dose is greater than 200 mg
international drug-induced skin pigmentation is estimated to account for 10-20% of all cases of acquired dyspigmentation worldwide
race  drug-induced pigmentary changes can occur in persons of any race, but hypomelanosis is seen more frequently and appears more dramatically in patients with darker-pigmented skin
additionally, people with darker skin often exhibit more intense hyperpigmentation than individuals with fair skin
sex  no differences are reported in the prevalence of drug-related pigmentation among males versus females
age  drug-related dyspigmentation is seen in persons of all ages
dyshidrotic eczema
background  dyshidrotic eczema is a type of eczema (dermatitis) of unknown cause that is characterized by a pruritic vesicular eruption on the fingers, palms, and soles
the condition affects teenagers and adults and may be acute, recurrent, or chronic
a more appropriate term for this vesicular eruption is pompholyx, which means bubble
the clinical course of dyshidrotic eczema can range from self-limited to chronic, severe, or debilitating
the condition's unresponsiveness to treatment can be frustrating for the patient and physician (see the images below)
tense vesicles and bullae on the palm

multiple tense vesicles on the palm
some believe the terms pompholyx and dyshidrosis are obsolete and favor a new term, such as "acute and recurrent vesicular hand dermatitis
" the etiology of dyshidrotic eczema is unresolved and is believed to be multifactorial
dyshidrotic eczema is considered to be a reaction pattern caused by various endogenous conditions and exogenous factors
see all about allergies: be ready for spring, a critical images slideshow, to help identify a variety of allergens and symptoms
etiology  the hypothesis of sweat gland dysfunction has been disputed because vesicles have not been shown to be associated with sweat ducts
a 2009 case report provided clear histopathologic evidence that sweat glands do not play a role in dyshidrosis
however, hyperhidrosis is an aggravating factor in 40% of patients with dyshidrotic eczema
improvement in pruritus, erythema, vesicles, and hand dermatitis with fewer or no signs of relapse has been obtained after onabotulinumtoxina injection
dyshidrotic eczema may be associated with atopy and familial atopy
of patients with dyshidrosis, 50% have atopic dermatitis
exogenous factors (eg, contact dermatitis to nickel, balsam, cobalt; sensitivity to ingested metals; dermatophyte infection; bacterial infection) may trigger episodes
these antigens may act as haptens with a specific affinity for palmoplantar proteins of the stratum lucidum of the epidermis
the binding of these haptens to tissue receptor sites may initiate pompholyx
evidence shows that the ingestion of metal ions such as cobalt can induce type i and type iv hypersensitivity reactions
in addition, they can also act as atypical haptens, activating t lymphocytes through human leukocyte antigen–independent pathways, causing systemic allergic dermatitis in the form of dyshidrotic eczema
emotional stressand environmental factors (eg, seasonal changes, hot or cold temperatures, humidity) reportedly exacerbate dyshidrosis
in addition, dyshidrosislike eczematous eruptions with the use of intravenous immunoglobulin infusions have been reported
dyshidrosislike eczematous eruptions with the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (ivig) infusions have been reported
a 2011 search of the literature identified pompholyx as one of the most important cutaneous adverse effects of ivig, being present in 62
5% of the patients reported, with 75% of those patients developing the lesions after just one ivig treatment
the eruption tends to be mild and to wane over time
it usually responds very well to topical steroids, but it may become recurrent and more aggressive after repeated doses of ivig
in some patients, a distant fungal infection can cause palmar pompholyx as an id reaction
in one study, one third of pompholyx occurrences on the palms resolved after treatment for tinea pedis
the factors believed to be associated with dyshidrotic eczema are discussed in more detail below
genetic factors  monozygotic twins have been affected simultaneously by dyshidrotic eczema
the pompholyx gene has been mapped to band 18q22
1-18q22
3 in the autosomal dominant form of familial pompholyx
mutations on the filaggrin gene leading to loss of filaggrin, a structural protein of the stratum corneum involved in the barrier function of the skin, causes dyskeratinization, increased transepidermal water loss, and an increase in the transepidermal antigen transfer
combined, these features have been associated with the development of icthyosis and atopic dermatitis, and they may be involved in the development of irritant and allergic contact dermatitis, which are well-known conditions associated with dyshidrotic eczema
chronic hand dermatitis, including dyshidrotis eczema, has also been associated with defects in the skin barrier, and, in a few cases, it has been also associated with mutations in the filaggrin gene; however, these have not reached statistical significance
aquaporins have been shown to be expressed in patients with atopic dermatitis and may also be related to exacerbation and chronicity of pompholyx
aquaporins are channel proteins located on cell membranes that increase their permeability, in particular aquaglyceroporins
aquaglyceroporins can transport water and glycerol
aquaporin-3 and aquaporin-10 are normally expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis, and immunohistochemical staining had demonstrated their presence in all epidermal layers in patients with pompholyx
these channels may participate in the increase of transepidermal water loss seen in atopic dermatitis and possibly in pompholyx
owing to osmotic gradients, among other factors, the direction of water and glycerol through aquaporins is from the skin to the environment, possibly contributing with skin dehydration, even immediately after hand washing
hypothetically, topical and/or systemic inhibition of the expression of aquaporins in the epidermis could contribute with the preservation of water and glycerol, decreasing the frequency and severity of pompholyx exacerbations
atopy  as many as 50% of patients with dyshidrotic eczema have reportedly had personal or familial atopic diathesis (eczema, asthma, hay fever, allergic sinusitis)
the serum immunoglobulin e (ige) level frequently is increased, even in patients who do not report a personal or familial history of atopy
occasionally, dyshidrotic eczema is the first manifestation of an atopic diathesis
nickel sensitivity  this may be a significant factor in dyshidrotic eczema
nickel sensitivity was reportedly low in some studies of dyshidrosis patients, but significantly elevated in other studies
increased nickel excretion in the urine has been reported during exacerbations of pompholyx
ingested metals have been found to provoke exacerbations of pompholyx in some patients
low-nickel diets have reportedly decreased the frequency and severity of pompholyx flares
a high palmoplantar perspiration rate has been suggested to result in a local concentration of metal salts that may provoke the vesicular reaction
contact allergy has been documented in 30% of patients with dyshidrotic eczema
cobalt sensitivity  the oral ingestion of cobalt manifests systemic allergic dermatitis as dyshidrotic eczema less frequently than does the oral ingestion of nickel
much more common is the simultaneous occurrence of nickel and cobalt allergy seen in 25% of nickel-sensitive patients developing pompholyx
in these cases, the eczema is usually more severe
when suspected as the cause of the dyshidrotic eczema, high oral ingestion of cobalt should be taken in consideration, regardless of the patch test results
a point-based, low-cobalt diet has been proposed to help patients limit cobalt ingestion and to keep the serum level below the threshold for developing flares, which is approximately less than 12 mcg/d
this diet has demonstrated higher compliance than an avoidance diet list
in addition, this diet reduces the amount of nickel consumed
exposure to sensitizing chemicals or metals  dyshidrotic eczema outbreaks are sometimes associated with exposure to sensitizing chemicals or metals (eg, chromium, cobalt, carba mix, fragrance mix, diaminodiphenylmethane, dichromates, benzoisothiazolones, paraphenylenediamine, perfumes, fragrances, balsam of peru, primula plant)
id reaction  controversy surrounds the possible existence of an id reaction, which is considered to be a distant dermatophyte infection (tinea pedis, kerion of scalp) triggering a palmar pompholyx reaction (also termed pompholyx dermatophytid)
fungal infection  pompholyx occasionally resolves when a tinea pedis infection is treated, then relapses when the fungal infection recurs, supporting the existence of this reaction pattern
of patients who have a vesicular reaction to intradermal trichophytin testing, less than one third have experienced a resolution of pompholyx after treatment with antifungal agents
emotional stress  this is a possible factor in dyshidrotic eczema
many patients report recurrences of pompholyx during stressful periods
improvement of dyshidrotic eczema using biofeedback techniques for stress reduction supports this hypothesis
other factors  isolated reports describe other possible causative factors, such as aspirin ingestion, oral contraceptives, cigarette smoking, and implanted metals, among others
a 3-year prospective study of the causes of dyshidrotic eczema (pompholyx) in 120 patients found causes of pompholyx related to contact exposure (67
5%), including to cosmetic products (31
7%) and metals (16
7%); interdigital-plantar intertrigo (10%); and internal factors (6
7%), with an additional 15% of patients having undiagnosed (idiopathic) causes probably related to atopic factors
contact allergy was found in 89 (74
2%) of the 120 patients
the most frequent allergens were nickel, shower gel, chromium, fragrance, shampoo, and balsam of peru
less frequent allergens were lanolin, cobalt, thiuram, lauryl sulfate, fresh tobacco, p -phenylenediamine (ppd), formaldehyde, parabens, and octyl gallate
in 97 of 193 positive patch test results, correlation existed between the application of the agent and pompholyx recurrence
the relevance of the analysis was confirmed in 81 (67
5%) of the 120 patients
in summary, the most frequent causes of pompholyx related to contact with substances were hygiene product intolerance (46
7%), metal allergy (25%), and others (28
3%)
intertrigo occurred in 19 (15
8%) of the 120 patients
of those individuals, 80% presented with dermatophytosis and 20% presented with candidiasis
after 3 weeks of antifungal therapy, 6 of 19 patients remained symptomatic for pompholyx
with regard to internal causes, 30 patients presented with a positive patch test result for metals, but only 2 presented with exacerbations of the lesions after a challenge test
of 58 patients with a history of smoking tobacco, 5 presented with a positive reaction, and 2 of those reactions were considered relevant
drug allergy was determined to be the causative agent in 3 patients (amoxicillin in 2 and intravenous immunoglobulin in 1)
food-related pompholyx was detected in 4 patients, and, after a challenge test, reactivation occurred in 3 of these patients (2 for paprika and 1 for orange juice)
ultraviolet a light  in a case series, 5 patients with prior diagnosis of pompholyx developed lesions morphologically and histologically consistent with a vesicular dermatitis after provocation with long-wavelength ultraviolet a (uva) light
further workup ruled out contact dermatitis, polymorphic light eruption, and heat as the culprit, confirming that the reaction was due to true photosensitivity rather than to photoaggravation
pompholyx caused by uva exposure may possibly be considered a variation of seasonal (summer) pompholyx
in the united states, dyshidrotic eczema is more commonly seen in warmer climates and during the spring and summer months
a study in turkey also revealed a higher prevalence of dyshidrotic eczema in the summer months
in a case series, three patients with histories of frequent pompholyx exacerbations, mostly during summer (ie, photoaggavated pompholyx), were subjected to photoprovocation testing, with positive development of pompholyx lesions in two of them
patients reported lesions after exposure to solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation and broadband uva
they were treated with photoprotective measures in addition to the standard treatment for pompholyx, resulting in a decrease in the frequency and severity of the exacerbations
the authors suggested that the condition may be underdiagnosed and recommended recognition and early detection to institute sun protection as soon as possible and to avoid starting phototherapy or photochemotherapy in this particular subset of pompholyx patients
of interest, uvb phototherapy and photochemotherapy are well-known, efficient treatments for pompholyx
epidemiology   occurrence in the united states  dyshidrotic eczema occurs in 5-20% of patients with hand eczema and more commonly develops in warmer climates and during spring and summer months (seasonal or summer pompholyx)
international occurrence  dyshidrotic eczema accounted for 1% of initial consultations in a 1-year swedish study
in a study of 107,206 swedish individuals, 51 (0
05%) were diagnosed with dyshidrosis
of all hand dermatitis cases in that population, 3% had dyshidrosis
in a retrospective study reviewing records of 714 portuguese patients during a 6-year period, magina et al found dyshidrotic eczema to be the third most common type of hand dermatitis (20
3%)
sex- and age-related demographics  the male-to-female ratio for dyshidrotic eczema has variably been reported as 1:1 and 1:2
dyshidrotic eczema affects individuals aged 4-76 years; the mean age is 38 years
the peak incidence of the condition occurs in patients aged 20-40 years
after middle age, the frequency of dyshidrotic eczema episodes tends to decrease
prognosis  dyshidrotic eczema follows a chronic, intermittent course, with fewer episodes occurring after middle age
some mildly affected patients experience spontaneous resolution within 2-3 weeks
(see treatment and medication
)  patient education  instruct dyshidrotic eczema patients to avoid contact with certain allergens or irritants (eg, nickel), to follow a hand care routine that avoids irritants, and to use emollients regularly
in addition, inform individuals with this disorder about the difficulty of achieving successful treatment

fixed drug eruptions
background  adverse reactions to medications are common and often manifest as a cutaneous eruption
drug-induced cutaneous disorders frequently display a characteristic clinical morphology such as morbilliform exanthem, urticaria, hypersensitivity syndrome, pseudolymphoma, photosensitivity, pigmentary changes, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, lichenoid dermatitis, vasculitis, stevens-johnson syndrome, or fixed drug eruption (fde)
the term fixed drug eruption describes the development of one or more annular or oval erythematous patches as a result of systemic exposure to a drug; these reactions normally resolve with hyperpigmentation and may recur at the same site with reexposure to the drug
repeated exposure to the offending drug may cause new lesions to develop in addition to "lighting up" the older hyperpigmented lesions
several variants of fixed drug eruption have been described, based on their clinical features and the distribution of the lesions
these include the following:  pigmenting fixed drug eruption generalized or multiple fixed drug eruption linear fixed drug eruption wandering fixed drug eruption nonpigmenting fixed drug eruption bullous fixed drug eruption eczematous fixed drug eruption urticarial fixed drug eruption erythema dyschromicum perstans–like fixed drug eruption vulvitis oral psoriasiform cellulitislike eruption    also see the following related medscape articles:  drug eruptions drug-induced bullous disorders drug-induced gingival hyperplasia drug-induced photosensitivity drug-induced pigmentation drug-induced pseudolymphoma syndrome  pathophysiology  although the exact mechanism is unknown, recent research suggests a cell-mediated process that initiates both the active and quiescent lesions
the process may involve an antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxic response
cd8 effector/memory t cells play an important role in reactivation of lesions with re-exposure to the offending drug
the offending drug is thought to function as a hapten that preferentially binds to basal keratinocytes, leading to an inflammatory response
through liberation of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, keratinocytes may locally up-regulate expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam1)
the up-regulated icam1 has been shown to help t cells (cd4 and cd8) migrate to the site of an insult
the newly arriving and residential cd8 cells likely perpetuate tissue damage by their production of the inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
cd8 cells isolated from active lesions have also been shown to express alpha e beta 7, a ligand for e-cadherin, which may further contribute to the lymphocyte’s ability to localize to the epidermis
other cell surface molecules, such as cla/alpha4beta1/cd4a, that bind e-selectin/vascular cellular adhesion molecule-2/icam1 help to further attract cd8 cells to the area
changes in cell surface markers allow vascular endothelium to select cd4 cells for migration into active lesions
these regulatory cd4 cells likely produce interleukin 10, which has been shown to help suppress immune function, resulting in a resting lesion
as the inflammatory response dissipates, interleukin 15 expression from keratinocytes is thought to help ensure the survival of cd8 cells, helping them fulfill their effector memory phenotypes
thus, when reexposure to the drug occurs, a more rapid response develops in the exact location of any prior lesions
epidemiology   frequency  united states the prevalence of drug eruptions has been reported to range from 2-5% for inpatients and greater than 1% for outpatients
fixed drug eruptions may account for as much as 16-21% of all cutaneous drug eruptions
the actual frequency may be higher than current estimates, owing to the availability of a variety of over-the-counter medications and nutritional supplements that are known to elicit fixed drug eruptions
international the international prevalence is variable but is likely similar to that in the united states
most studies report fixed drug eruptions to be the second or third most common skin manifestation of adverse drug events
race  fixed drug eruptions have no known racial predilection
a genetic susceptibility to developing a fixed drug eruption with an increased incidence of hla-b22 is possible
sex  one large study of 450 patients revealed a male-to-female ratio of 1:1
1 for fixed drug eruptions
age  fixed drug eruptions have been reported in patients as young as 1
5 years and as old as 87 years
the mean age at presentation is 30
4 years in males and 31
3 years in females
prognosis  the prognosis is very good, and an uneventful recovery should be expected
no deaths due to fixed drug eruption have been reported
residual hyperpigmentation is very common, but this is less likely with the nonpigmenting variant
widespread lesions may initially mimic toxic epidermal necrolysis, but they have a benign clinical course
again, localized hyperpigmentation is a common complication, but pain, infection, and, rarely, hypopigmentation, also may occur
patient education  patients should be counseled on medication avoidance and possible cross-reactions of similar medications
patients should notify their physicians of all drug allergies they have experienced
id reaction (autoeczematization)
background  id reaction, or autoeczematization, is a generalized acute cutaneous reaction to a variety of stimuli, including infectious and inflammatory skin conditions
the pruritic rash that characterizes the id reaction, which is considered immunologic in origin, has been referred to as dermatophytid,pediculid,or bacterid when associated with a corresponding infectious process
clinical and histopathological manifestations are variable and depend on the etiology of the eruption

pathophysiology  while the exact cause of the id reaction is unknown, the following factors are thought to be responsible: (1) abnormal immune recognition of autologous skin antigens, (2) increased stimulation of normal t cells by altered skin constituents,(3) lowering of the irritation threshold, (4) dissemination of infectious antigen with a secondary response, and (5) hematogenous dissemination of cytokines from a primary site
some cases have been related to medications and intravenous immune globulin
id reaction has also been noted with bcg therapy
epidemiology   frequency  the exact prevalence of id reaction is not known
dermatophytid reactions are reported to occur in 4-5% of patients with dermatophyte infections
id reactions have been reported in up to 37% of patients with stasis dermatitis
furthermore, an estimated two thirds of patients with contact dermatitis superimposed on stasis dermatitis develop an id reaction
race  the condition has no known predilection for any racial or ethnic group
sex  the condition has no known predilection for either sex
age  predilections according to age group are unknown but are influenced by the primary cause of the reaction
prognosis  prognosis is good once the inciting etiology has been identified and appropriately treated
morbidity results from symptoms of the id reaction and the acute onset of the primary eruption
immediate hypersensitivity reactions
background  the immune system is an integral part of human protection against disease, but the normally protective immune mechanisms can sometimes cause detrimental reactions in the host
such reactions are known as hypersensitivity reactions, and the study of these is termed immunopathology
the traditional classification for hypersensitivity reactions is that of gell and coombs and is currently the most commonly known classification system
it divides the hypersensitivity reactions into the following 4 types:   type i reactions (ie, immediate hypersensitivity reactions) involve immunoglobulin e (ige)–mediated release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells and basophils
examples include anaphylaxis and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis
type ii reactions (ie, cytotoxic hypersensitivity reactions) involve immunoglobulin g or immunoglobulin m antibodies bound to cell surface antigens, with subsequent complement fixation
an example is drug-induced hemolytic anemia
type iii reactions (ie, immune-complex reactions) involve circulating antigen-antibody immune complexes that deposit in postcapillary venules, with subsequent complement fixation
an example is serum sickness
type iv reactions (ie, delayed hypersensitivity reactions, cell-mediated immunity) are mediated by t cells rather than by antibodies
an example is contact dermatitis from poison ivy or nickel allergy
some authors believe this classification system may be too general and favor a more recent classification system proposed by sell et al
this system divides immunopathologic responses into the following 7 categories:  inactivation/activation antibody reactions cytotoxic or cytolytic antibody reactions immune-complex reactions allergic reactions t-cell cytotoxic reactions delayed hypersensitivity reactions granulomatous reactions this system accounts for the fact that multiple components of the immune system can be involved in various types of hypersensitivity reactions
for example, t cells play an important role in the pathophysiology of allergic reactions (see pathophysiology)
in addition, the term immediate hypersensitivity is somewhat of a misnomer because it does not account for the late-phase reaction or for the chronic allergic inflammation that often occurs with these types of reactions
allergic reactions manifest clinically as anaphylaxis, allergic asthma, urticaria, angioedema, allergic rhinitis, some types of drug reactions, and atopic dermatitis
these reactions tend to be mediated by ige, which differentiates them from non-ige-mediated (formerly called anaphylactoid) reactions that involve ige-independent mast cell and basophil degranulation
such reactions can be caused by iodinated radiocontrast dye, opiates, or vancomycin and appear similar clinically to urticaria or even anaphylaxis
patients prone to ige-mediated allergic reactions are said to be atopic
atopy is the genetic predisposition to make ige antibodies in response to allergen exposure
